/** Find real roots of a quadratic equation with real coefficients

 \param a quadratic coefficient
 \param b linear coefficient
 \param c constant coefficient
 \param x0 (out parameter, non-NULL) where to store the smallest root
 \param x1 (out parameter, non-NULL) where to store the largest root

 \return Return code which classifies provided quadratic equation â€” value of
 \ref quadratic_equation_rc type. \c x0 and \c x1 are populated with root
 values. If there are less than two solutions, remaining values are set to NAN.

 This function doesn't check input values for NANs and infinities.
 This function uses discriminant method, which may make results highly
 imprecise.
